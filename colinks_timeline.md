---

## API Integration Guidelines

### Standard Integration Pattern

#### 1. Setup API Service Function

```javascript
// services/api.js
import axios from 'axios';

const apiService = {
  // GET request
  getData: async (endpoint) => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get(endpoint);
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      throw handleApiError(error);
    }
  },
  
  // POST request
  postData: async (endpoint, data) => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(endpoint, data);
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      throw handleApiError(error);
    }
  }
};
```

#### 2. Component Integration

```javascript
// components/BusinessList.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { apiService } from '../services/api';

const BusinessList = () => {
  const [businesses, setBusinesses] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBusinesses();
  }, []);

  const fetchBusinesses = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const data = await apiService.getData('/api/businesses');
      setBusinesses(data);
    } catch (error) {
      setError(error.message);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage message={error} />;

  return (
    <div>
      {businesses.map(business => (
        <BusinessCard key={business.id} business={business} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Error Handling Standards

#### API Error Handler

```javascript
const handleApiError = (error) => {
  if (error.response) {
    // Server responded with error status
    return {
      message: error.response.data.message || 'Server error occurred',
      status: error.response.status
    };
  } else if (error.request) {
    // Network error
    return {
      message: 'Network error. Please check your connection.',
      status: 'network'
    };
  } else {
    // Other error
    return {
      message: 'An unexpected error occurred',
      status: 'unknown'
    };
  }
};
```

### Loading States Implementation

#### Loading Component

```javascript
const LoadingSpinner = () => (
  <div className="flex justify-center items-center p-4">
    <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-8 w-8 border-b-2 border-blue-600"></div>
  </div>
);
```

### Authentication Integration

#### Axios Interceptor Setup

```javascript
// Setup request interceptor to add auth token
axios.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
);

// Setup response interceptor to handle token expiry
axios.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Token expired, redirect to login
      localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
      window.location.href = '/login';
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing Approach

#### 1. Unit Testing (Individual API Integrations)

- Test each API service function
- Mock API responses for consistent testing
- Verify error handling scenarios
- Test data transformation logic

#### 2. Component Testing (API + UI Integration)

- Test component behavior with API data
- Test loading states and error states
- Verify user interactions trigger correct API calls
- Test form submissions and data updates

#### 3. End-to-End Testing (Complete User Flows)

- Test complete user journeys
- Verify data persistence across pages
- Test authentication flows
- Test business processes (onboarding, posting, messaging)

#### 4. Performance Testing

- Test API response times
- Test application performance with large datasets
- Test concurrent user scenarios
- Monitor memory usage and optimization

### Testing Tools

- **Unit Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing:** Cypress or Playwright
- **API Testing:** Postman or Insomnia
